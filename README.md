## 🚀 Introduction

Cart.AI is a personal AI agent, delivered through a Chrome Extension, designed to revolutionize your online shopping experience. By asking a single question, you can have products from various digital platforms added directly to your cart, bypassing the time-consuming search process.

## 🌐 Example Use Cases

- **Instagram Fashion:** See an outfit you love on Instagram? Ask Cart.AI to add it to your cart.
- **YouTube Guides:** Loved a skincare routine from a YouTube guide? Cart.AI will add all the featured products to your cart and even provide personalized buying suggestions based on AI analysis of the video and the wider internet.
- **Netflix Meals:** Spotted a mouth-watering dish on a Netflix show? Ask Cart.AI to get it ordered for you.

## 💰 Business Model

Our primary goal is user base growth, achieved and measured through:

- **Affiliate Links:** Cart.AI recommends products via automatically generated affiliate links (such as those on Amazon).
- **Vendor Partnerships:** We seek partnerships with a variety of vendors and shops to facilitate more orders and, consequently, more revenue.

## 🎯 Future Goals

- **Online Shopping Aggregator:** We aim to aggregate products from various online stores into a single, unified shopping cart, creating a more convenient purchasing process.
- **Mobile Frontend:** Future expansion to mobile platforms is planned.
- **Metaverse:** With the potential of wider metaverse adoption, Cart.AI is set to increase its market share of online goods.

## 👥 Development
